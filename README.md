# HalvedPlanetSpawn
Simple mod for Distant Worlds 2 to halve the number of planets spawned in a galaxy.

**REQUIREMENTS**

ModLauncher v1.2.1, which can be downloaded here -- https://github.com/DW2MC/DW2ModLoader/releases/tag/v1.2.1


**WHAT THIS MOD DOES**

This mod is very simple. It changes the maximum number of planets that can generate around Main Sequence Stars, Red Giants,
Super Giants, and Blue Giants. In vanilla game, these can have 8 planets orbitting them. This mod halves that to 4.

This both makes resources more scarce in the galaxy, and also straight up reduces the amount of habitable planets that can be found in a galaxy rather
than changing the quality range like the Colony Prevalence settings used by the game.


**RECOMMENDED GALAXY SETTINGS**

Choose normal for performance reasons, so that there are less habitable planets of a sufficient quality to support a profitable colony. 

Choose abundant to help the AI expand more easily and have a more balanced game against them.

**INSTALLATION**

1. Go to your Distant Worlds 2 installation, and navigate to the mods folder which will be in the main directory. This folder
will have been included in the ModLauncher files. If this is not present, be sure to open up the ModLauncher zip files and bring the mods folder into your
installation directory.


2. Either place the HalvedPlanetSpawn.zip into the mods folder, right click and select Extract Here. Or extract the zip files and manually choose the directory
to place the unzipped files into - this needs to be in the mods folder, and be in its own folder named HalvedPlanetSpawn.

3. Make sure to keep the YAML files within the HalvedPlanetSpawn/data folder.


**FAQ**

1. Can I safely delete this mod after generating a galaxy?
   -You certainly can. Mod is only needed to initially generate the galaxy for your playthrough. After that it can be removed.
But this also means that if you're not enjoying how scarce both resources and planets are, you will need to start a new game on a new galaxy.
